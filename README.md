# A Template for uConsole Expansion Card

I'm now generously releasing a simple KiCAD template for customizing uConsole expansion cards. This original work was for a custom expansion card which ceased production.

This is not a standard KiCAD template but rather a project skeleton.

- PCB contains 2 layers, and the thickness is 1 mm.
- The manufacturing was done by JLCPCB.
- The board outline was drawn/traced with FreeCAD.

Do not move the footprints of speakers or mini PCIe connector.

Use at your own risk. The data is not guaranteed to be accurate.
